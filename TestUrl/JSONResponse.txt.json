I didn't want ANYTHING to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, my roomie arrives home. He is terrified and immediately gives up his rights. Unbelievably stupid, I know.

We both have 100% clean records, no money was found, no weapons, etc. I can't afford a lawyer just yet either. No police report has been filed, no mention of it in the papers...nothing. For over 2 months. Hell, they even left some grinders and papers, and a little weed on the tables, so obviously we weren't some huge threat.  There were some odd things involved too...the wrap sheet had items listed in incorrect places (which pictures contradict), they literally blocked the doorway physically and said we can either sit in the cruiser or let them in before my roomie gave up his rights, threatened to break everything if they got a warrant...\r\n\r\nAt this point, I know my friend is screwed. However, I literally didn't do a SINGLE THING to contribute to his little operation. Realistically, does anyone have any advice to give to me? Any idea how ruined my life is going to be over something that I had nothing to do with?", "likes": null, "saved": false, "id": "czoh3", "clicked": false, "author": "BombsOutOfBibles", "media": null, "score": 37, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "downs": 30, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/czoh3/roomate_got_busted_with_a_grow_operationhow/", "name": "t3_czoh3", "created": 1281502783.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/comments/czoh3/roomate_got_busted_with_a_grow_operationhow/", "title": "Roomate got busted with a grow operation...how screwed am I?", "created_utc": 1281477583.0, "num_comments": 180, "ups": 67}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "i.imgur.com", "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "funny", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "saved": false, "id": "cziwi", "clicked": false, "author": "oldtymelemonade", "media": null, "score": 580, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh33", "downs": 694, "is_self": false, "permalink": "/r/funny/comments/cziwi/you_say_tomato_i_say_tomato_pic/", "name": "t3_cziwi", "created": 1281478313.0, "url": "http://i.imgur.com/smFAT.jpg", "title": "You say tomato, I say tomato...

I'll rest when\nI'm the very best\nAnd I control the game\nLike start/select is on my chest, man\nYeah, There's only direction where I wanna go \nSide scroll, and I know\nEverything that lies ahead of me like\nI\"ve got a strategy guide for my life\nAnd I'm sure\nI can do the impossible\nI'm unstoppable, like Santigold\nAll my obstacles better hope they got codes\nCause imma takeover like Hova\nGod mode\nI'm feeling invincible\nImma be a star man\nPulling strings from the top\nYou can call it harping\nIf this is your castle\nExcuse me while I barge in \nAnd my grind don't pause\nSo don't bother pressing start then \n\nI'll make my way to the end\nCan't stop me now\nI don't care what they do\nI don't play to lose, no\nAnd I'll take on every threat\nThey get stomped to the ground\nI'm the one to fear \nI'll fight like I've got lives to spare\n \nThis life is just a game\nAnd everyone in the world is playing\nAnd we're all tryna make our way\nTo the end we all see in our dreams\nSo I'm leaving the ground behind me\nLook past the stars if you're tryna find me\nIf you're playing to see me lose\nWatch what I'm bout to do\nIt's game over for you \n \nI swear my peers will turn green when they see me\nThis is my world\nYall can fight to be Luigi\nI grind all night call it tantric\nEverytime sit down and write I make magic\nPick up the pen and and tell'em\nWhat's going on around my cerebellum\nAnd if you think you're anything more than a Robin to my Batman\nYour skull must be quite thick\nStay silent like sidekicks\nWhile I get, Blackberry Bold\nCause shy guys don't get the throne, they get thrown\nWhat I write is gonna take me where I wanna go\nAuthor becomes king like the sword in the stone\nAnd in this game I'm doing more than holding my own\nI'm skipping over all their levels, warp zone\nI want it all \nGuess I'm greedy, Wario\nLames sayin we, but I don't need two eyes to see that\nWhile I run the game, boy you'll stay small\nPortable", "title": "Game Over
